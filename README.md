mmm that feels SO. good!. well, in the dog days of summer, there's n00000thing as refreshing as a cool breeze, a dip in the ocean, or a plunge into a cool, mountain lake. i REALLy wanted to be in maine this week and join the ocean but, as you can see, i had to work here at the studio with everybody around me

so i thought that on today's show we bask in some of the other pleasures that we get from fresh AND salt water! we have a DELLLicious recipe for grilling! river fresh brook trout. and i'll show you how to make a tote bag! perfect for a day at the beach. plus, we'll journey to the isle of anglesey in northern wales to see how a very special salt is harvested from the sea. today's show is FILLLEd with cool ideas, for that HOT. summer day.
